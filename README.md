# Machine Learning with Python – FreeCodeCamp Certification Projects

This repository contains my completed projects for the **Machine Learning with Python** certification offered by [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). As part of the certification, I was tasked with completing five hands-on challenges that demonstrate my understanding of supervised learning, model evaluation, and real-world data applications using Python.

Each project focuses on a core machine learning concept and was built from scratch using Python, relevant libraries like `TensorFlow`, `Scikit-Learn`, `Pandas`, and `Numpy`, and a clean, reproducible workflow.

## ✅ Completed Projects

### 🪨 Rock Paper Scissors
A simple classification model that simulates a rock-paper-scissors game and predicts the user’s next move using pattern recognition.

### 🐶 Cat and Dog Image Classifier
An image classification project that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to distinguish between images of cats and dogs.

### 📚 Book Recommendation Engine using KNN
A collaborative filtering system built using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to recommend books based on user preferences.

### 📉 Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator
A regression model that predicts health insurance costs using linear regression based on features like age, BMI, and smoking status.

### 📩 Neural Network SMS Text Classifier
A text classification project that uses a neural network to detect whether an SMS message is spam or not.
